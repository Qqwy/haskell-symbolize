description: |
  Symbols, also known as Atoms or Interned Strings, are a common technique
  to reduce memory usage and improve performance when using many small strings:

  A Symbol represents a string (any `Textual`, so String, Text, ShortText, ByteString, ShortByteString, etc.)

  Just like `ShortText`, `ShortByteString` and `ByteArray`, a `Symbol` has an optimized memory representation,
  directly wrapping a primitive `ByteArray#`.

  Furthermore, a global symbol table keeps track of which values currently exist, ensuring we always deduplicate symbols.
  This therefore allows us to:

  - Check for equality between symbols in constant-time (using pointer equality)
  - Calculate the hash in constant-time (using `StableName`)
  - Keep the memory footprint of repeatedly-seen strings low.

  This is very useful if you're frequently comparing strings
  and the same strings might come up many times.
  It also makes Symbol a great candidate for a key in e.g. a `HashMap` or `HashSet`.

  The global symbol table is implemented using weak pointers,
  which means that unused symbols will be garbage collected.
  As such, you do not need to be concerned about memory leaks
  (as is the case with many other symbol table implementations).
